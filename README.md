# Image caption generator

This project, as the name suggests, is an Image Caption Generator. It utilizes Hugging Face Transformers to harness the power of the BLIP model (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining) from Salesforce, and employs Gradio to create a simple and intuitive web interface. The tool allows users to upload an image, after which the model generates a descriptive caption based on the content of the image.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the capabilities and importance of computer vision and artificial intelligence in automating image understanding.
